# Sex and The City
## Intro

Yes, this may seem to be a joke but this project I felt would be a good practice
in doing some stuff in Natural Language Processing. I found a dataset on Kaggle
where someone broke down every line from Sex and the City and turned it into one
massive dataset. I picture a project that will allow a user to see who had the
most positive/negative lines per episode. It will also show which characters had
the most lines for each season and episode.

The process for how I do the sentiment analysis is that I loop through every line,
by season, by character, and get the sentiment for each line. I then average the
sentiment for each character and use that to display on the graph. I'm not sure
how accurate/right that is to do. The concept is more proof of concept than
anything.
