# Sex and The City
## Intro

Yes, this may seem to be a joke but this project I felt would be a good practice
in doing some stuff in Natural Language Processing. I found a dataset on Kaggle
where someone broke down every line from Sex and the City and turned it into one
massive dataset. I picture a project that will allow a user to see who had the
most positive/negative lines per episode.
